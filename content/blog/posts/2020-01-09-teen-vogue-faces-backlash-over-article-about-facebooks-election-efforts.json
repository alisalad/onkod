  "body": "A Teen Vogue story that featured interviews with[Facebook](https://www.cnet.com/tags/facebook/)executives involved in the social network's efforts to protect the integrity of the[2020 election](https://www.cbsnews.com/race-to-2020/)has disappeared from the popular site after critics worried it was an advertorial.\n\nTeen Vogue appears to have deleted the story, in which five senior Facebook employees described steps the social network was taking to prevent Facebook from being used to influence the election. Clicking on the[Teen Vogue link](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/how-facebook-is-helping-ensure-the-integrity-of-the-2020-election)takes you to a page that reads, \"Unfortunately this page does not exist. Please check your URL or return to the Homepage.\"\n\nAn archived version of the story is available on the Internet Archive's[Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20200108170304/https://www.teenvogue.com/story/how-facebook-is-helping-ensure-the-integrity-of-the-2020-election).\n\nThe article immediately prompted critics on[Twitter](https://www.cnet.com/tags/twitter/)to question whether the story, which didn't include an author byline, was paid for by Facebook, a practice known as an advertorial or sponsored content. Business Insider, which earlier reported on the Teen Vogue article, said the story was amended at one point to include[an editor's note](https://www.businessinsider.com/teen-vogue-story-on-facebook-prompts-sponsored-content-questions-vanishes-2020-1)labeling the piece as sponsored content, before it was removed entirely."
